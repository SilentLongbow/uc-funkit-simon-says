Game Description:
    The game implemented is a form of the well known game "Simon Says". One player sends a sequence of directions to the other player, where that sequence quickly plays across the receivers LED matrix.
    The receiver must then replicate the message. If they are correct, they receive a point. Only the receiver can gain a point each round.
    Once the round is over, both players have their roles swapped. This carries on until either player gains three points. At that point a winner is announced and the game concludes.
